			<h1>Web Services</h1>
			<div class="section">
				<h2>1. What is your understanding of Web Services?</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					Web services are standardized ways for applications to communicate over a network. They typically use XML, JSON, or other formats to send data between client and server. They rely on protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, or SOAP for communication. 
					RESTful services (Representational State Transfer) are lightweight, using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, while SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is more rigid and supports a higher level of security.
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>2. Can you explain the request/response cycle in web services?</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					In a typical request/response cycle, the client sends a request to a web service, which includes a URL, method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), headers, and body. 
					The server processes the request and sends back a response, which includes a status code (200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for internal server error), headers, and the response body containing the result, typically in JSON or XML.
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>3. What are common issues you have encountered when consuming web services?</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					Common issues include:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Timeouts</strong>: When the web service takes too long to respond.</li>
						<li><strong>Authentication Failures</strong>: Due to misconfigurations or expired tokens.</li>
						<li><strong>Data Format Issues</strong>: Mismatches between the expected and provided data format (JSON vs XML).</li>
						<li><strong>Rate Limiting</strong>: Exceeding the service’s usage limits.</li>
						<li><strong>Service Unavailability</strong>: Due to downtime or maintenance.</li>
						<li><strong>Incorrect HTTP Status Codes</strong>: For example, receiving a 500 internal server error or 404 not found.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>4. How do you troubleshoot web services issues?</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					To troubleshoot web service issues:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Check Logs</strong>: Review client and server-side logs for errors or unexpected status codes.</li>
						<li><strong>Test the Endpoint</strong>: Use tools like Postman or curl to send requests and examine responses.</li>
						<li><strong>Check Authentication</strong>: Ensure proper API key/token passing.</li>
						<li><strong>Validate Data</strong>: Check that the correct data format is used (JSON, XML).</li>
						<li><strong>Monitor Performance</strong>: Check response times and rate-limiting status.</li>
						<li><strong>Check Endpoint and Version</strong>: Verify correct endpoint and API version usage.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>5. Can you explain what RESTful API is and how it works?</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for web services, relying on stateless communication and using standard HTTP methods:
					<ul>

			<h1>Networking</h1>
			<div class="section">
				<h2>1. What is your understanding of the TCP/IP protocol suite?</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					The TCP/IP protocol suite is the foundation for communication over the internet. It is structured into four layers:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Application Layer:</strong> Handles communication between applications and defines protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP.</li>
						<li><strong>Transport Layer:</strong> Manages end-to-end data transmission and includes protocols like TCP and UDP.</li>
						<li><strong>Internet Layer:</strong> Handles routing and addressing of packets using protocols like IP (Internet Protocol).</li>
						<li><strong>Link Layer:</strong> Defines how data is physically transmitted over a network, including Ethernet and Wi-Fi.</li>
					</ul>
					The TCP/IP model ensures reliable, scalable communication across the internet, breaking down data into packets for efficient routing.
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>2. Can you explain the difference between TCP and UDP?</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are transport-layer protocols:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>TCP:</strong> A connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data delivery with error checking and retransmission of lost packets.</li>
						<li><strong>UDP:</strong> A connectionless protocol that does not guarantee delivery or error checking, making it faster but less reliable than TCP.</li>
					</ul>
					TCP is suitable for applications where data integrity is critical, such as web browsing and file transfers, while UDP is used for real-time applications like video streaming or online gaming where speed is more important than reliability.
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>3. How does the IP protocol work in the context of networking?</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					The Internet Protocol (IP) operates at the Internet layer of the TCP/IP suite. It is responsible for addressing and routing packets of data across networks.
					<ul>
						<li><strong>IP Addressing:</strong> Each device on a network is assigned a unique IP address (IPv4 or IPv6), which identifies it within the network.</li>
						<li><strong>Routing:</strong> IP routers direct packets to their destination by examining the destination IP address in each packet and determining the best path for it to take.</li>
						<li><strong>Packet Fragmentation:</strong> If packets exceed the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of a network, they are fragmented and reassembled at the destination.</li>
					</ul>
					IP is fundamental for data transfer over the internet, enabling devices to communicate with one another through a defined addressing and routing system.
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>4. What is DNS and how does it function?</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					DNS (Domain Name System) is responsible for translating human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers can use to identify and locate resources on a network.
					<ul>
						<li><strong>DNS Query:</strong> When a user types a domain name into a browser, a DNS query is sent to a DNS server to resolve the domain into its corresponding IP address.</li>
						<li><strong>DNS Resolution:</strong> If the IP address is not cached, DNS recursively searches authoritative name servers to find the correct address.</li>
						<li><strong>DNS Records:</strong> DNS servers maintain various record types such as A (address), CNAME (canonical name), and MX (mail exchange).</li>
					</ul>
					DNS acts like a phonebook for the internet, enabling users to access websites and services using easily memorable names instead of numeric IP addresses.
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>5. What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					IPv4 and IPv6 are both addressing protocols used to identify devices on a network:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>IPv4:</strong> The most widely used protocol, employing a 32-bit address scheme that provides around 4.3 billion unique addresses.</li>
						<li><strong>IPv6:</strong> A newer protocol designed to solve the IPv4 address exhaustion problem, using a 128-bit address scheme, which provides an almost infinite number of unique addresses.</li>
					</ul>
					IPv6 adoption is increasing as the demand for IP addresses grows, and it also offers improvements in routing efficiency and security over IPv4.
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>6. How does HTTP work, and what is its role in web communications?</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is an application layer protocol used for transferring hypertext documents (web pages) over the internet.
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Request-Response Model:</strong> HTTP operates on a request-response model, where the client (e.g., web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server, which then responds with the requested resource (e.g., HTML file).</li>
						<li><strong>Stateless Protocol:</strong> HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent and does not retain any information from previous requests. To maintain state, technologies like cookies or sessions are used.</li>
						<li><strong>Methods:</strong> Common HTTP methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).</li>
					</ul>
					HTTP is the backbone of web communication, enabling the transfer of text, images, videos, and other resources that form the web.
				</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class="section">
				<h2>7. Can you explain what a subnet mask is and its purpose in networking?</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					A subnet mask is used in IP networking to divide an IP address into two parts: one that identifies the network and the other that identifies the host within that network.
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Network Portion:</strong> The part of the IP address defined by the subnet mask that identifies the network.</li>
						<li><strong>Host Portion:</strong> The remaining part of the IP address that identifies individual devices within the network.</li>
						<li><strong>Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR):</strong> A modern method for representing IP addresses and subnet masks, using the notation “IP address/Prefix length” (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).</li>
					</ul>
					Subnetting allows network administrators to efficiently manage IP addresses and improve routing performance by segmenting larger networks into smaller, more manageable subnets.

				<h2>5. Diagnostic Tools: Performance Monitor, Reliability Monitor, and Memory Diagnostics</h2>
				<p><strong>Solution:</strong><br>
					Windows offers several diagnostic tools to help identify system issues:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Performance Monitor:</strong> This tool allows you to monitor system performance in real time. It tracks metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and disk activity. You can access it via <code>perfmon</code> in the Run dialog.
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Usage:</strong> Track performance counters, create performance logs, and generate reports for analysis.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Reliability Monitor:</strong> This tool provides a timeline of system events, including application crashes, hardware failures, and other critical system changes.
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Usage:</strong> Track system stability and troubleshoot application and system issues.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Memory Diagnostics:</strong> This tool tests system memory (RAM) for errors, which can cause crashes and performance issues.
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Usage:</strong> Use the <code>mdsched</code> command to run memory diagnostics and check for errors in the RAM.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					These diagnostic tools help ensure the system is operating optimally and can assist in troubleshooting.
